# GameFrameWork
**We provide framework** that game designers can use to create strategy games while removing the burden of coding repetitive tasks from the game design. 

The game system framework will provide core for games.

It will be delivered as a library of classes usable by all board game devolpment project teams.

The framework will provide standard capabilities for:
```
- Defining and representing a board configuration
- Defining Troops and configuring armies
- Moving units on the board
- Conducting battles
- Providing unit information
```
*Our Framework will devote time to implementing the actual games*
